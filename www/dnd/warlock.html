<h1><a id="Warlock_0"></a>Warlock</h1>
<p>With a pseudodragon curled on his shoulder, a young elf in golden robes smiles warmly, weaving a magical charm into his honeyed words and bending the palace sentinel to his will.</p>
<p>As flames spring to life in her hands, a wizened human whispers the secret name of her demonic patron, infusing her spell with fiendish magic.</p>
<p>Shifting his gaze between a battered tome and the odd alignment of the stars overhead, a wild-eyed tiefling chants the mystic ritual that will open a doorway to a distant world.</p>
<p>Warlocks are seekers of the knowledge that lies hidden in the fabric of the multiverse.  Through pacts made with mysterious beings of supernatural power, warlocks unlock magical effects both subtle and spectacular.  Drawing on the ancient knowledge of being such as fey nobles, demons, devils, hags, and alien entities of hte Far Realms, warlocks piece together arcane secretes to bolster their own power.</p>
<h3><a id="Sworn_and_Beholden_33"></a>Sworn and Beholden</h3>
<p>A warlock is defined by a pact with an otherworldly being.  Sometimes the relationship between warlock and patron is like that of a cleric and a deity, though the beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are not gods.  A warlock might lead a cult dedicated to a demon prince, an archdevil, or an utterly alien entity-beings not typicallky served by clerics.  More often, though, the arrangement is similar to that between a master and an apprentice.  The warlock learns and grows in power, at the cost of occasional services performed on the patron's behalf.</p>
<p>The magic bestoed on a warlock ranges from minor but lasting alterations to the warlcok's being (such as the ability to see in darkness or to read any language) to access to powerful spells.  Unlike bookish wizards, warlocks supplement their magic with some facility at hand-to-hand combat.  They are comfortable in light armor and know how to use simple weapons.</p>
<h3><a id="Delvers_into_Secrets_39"></a>Delvers into Secrets</h3>
<p>Warlocks are driven by an insatiable need for knowledge and power, which compels them into their pacts and shapes their lives.  This thirst drives warlcoks into their pacts and shapes their later careers as well.</p>
<p>Stories of warlocks binding themselves to fiends are widely known.  But many warlocks serve patrons that are not fiendish.  Sometimes a traveler in the wilds comes to a strangely beautiful tower, meets its fey lord or lady, and sumbles into a pact without being fully aware of it.  And sometimes, while poring over tomes of forbidden lore, a briliant but crazed student's mind is opened to realities beyond the material world and to the alien beings that dwell in the outer void.</p>
<p>Once a pact is made, a warlaock's thirst for knowledge and power can't be slaked with mere study and research.  No one makes a pact with such a mighty patron if he she doesn't intend to use the power thus gained.  Rather, the vast majority of warlcoks spend their days in activbe persuit of their goals, which typically means some kind of adventuring.  Further more, the demands of their patrons drive warlcoks toward adventure.</p>
<h3><a id="Createing_a_Warlock_47"></a>Createing a Warlock</h3>
<p>As you make your warlock character, spend some time thinking aobut your patron and the obligations that your pact imposes upon you.  What led you to make the pact, and how did you make contact with your patron?  Were you seduced into summoning a devil, or did you seek out the ritual that would allow you to make contact with an alien elder god?  Did you search for your patron, or did your patron find and choose you?  Do you chafe under the obligations of your pact or serve joyfully in anticipation of th rewards promised to you?</p>
<p>Work with your DM to determine how big a part your pact will play in yoru character's adventuring career.  Your patron's demands might drive you to adventures, or they might consist entirely of small favors you can do between adventures.</p>
<p>What kind of relationshipd do yo uahve with your patron?  Is it friendly , antagonistic, uneasy, or romantic?  How important does yoru patron consider you to be?  What part do you play in yoru patron's plans?  Do you know other servants of your patron?</p>
<p>How does your patron communicate with you?  If you have a familiar, it might occasionally speak with your patron's voice.  Some warlocks find meassages from the patrons etched on trees, mingled among tea leaves, or adrift in the coulds-messages that only the warlock can see.  Other warlcoks converse with their patrons in dreams or waking visions, or deal only with intermediaries.</p>

<h3><a id="Pact_Magic_96"></a>Pact Magic</h3>
<p>Your arcane research and the magic bestowed on you by your patron have given you facility with spells.  See chapter 10 for the general rules of spellcasting and chapter 11 for the warlock spell list.</p>

To cast one of your warlock spells of 1st level or hgiher, you must expend a spell slot.  You regain all expended spell slots when you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<p>For example, when you are 5th level, you have two 3rd-level spell slots.  To cast the 1st-level spell <em>thuderwave</em>, you must spend one of those slots, and you cast it as a 3rd-level spell.</p>
<h4><a id="Spells_Known_of_1st_Level_and_Higher_110"></a>Spells Known of 1st Level and Higher</h4>

<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in the class, you can choose one of the warlock spells you know and replace it with another spell from the warlock spell list, which also must be of a level for which you have spell slots.</p>
<h4><a id="Spellcasting_Ability_118"></a>Spellcasting Ability</h4>
<p>Charisma is your spellcasting ability for your warlock spells, so you use your Charisma whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.  In addiont, you use your Charisma modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a warlock spell you cast and when making an attack roll with one.</p>
<p><strong>Spell save DC</strong> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier</p>
<p><strong>Spell attack modifier</strong> = your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifer</p>
<h4><a id="Spellcasting_Focus_126"></a>Spellcasting Focus</h4>

<p>At 2nd level, you gain two eldritch invocations of your choice.  Your invocation options are detailed at the end of the class description.  When you gain certain warlock levels, you gain additional invocations of your choice, as shown in the Invocations Known column of the Warlock table.</p>
<p>Additionally, when you gain a level in the class, you can choose one of the invocations you know and replace it with another invocation that you could learn at that level.</p>

<h4><a id="Pact_of_the_Blade_150"></a>Pact of the Blade</h4>
<p>You can use your action to create a pact weaon in your empty hand.  You can choose the form that this melee weapon takes each time you create it (see chapter 5 for weapon options).  You are proficient with it while your wield it.  This weapon counts as magical for the purpose of overcoming resistance and immunity to nonmagical attacks and damage.</p>
<p>Your pact weaon disappears if it is more that 5 feet away from you for 1 mintue or more.  It also disappears if you use this feature again, if you dismiss the weapon (no action required), or if you die.</p>
<p>Youc an transform one magic weapon into your pact weapon by performing a special ritual while you hold the weapon.  You perform the ritual over the course of 1 hour, which can be done during a short rest.  You can then dismiss the weapon, shunting it into an extradimensional space, and it appears whenever you create your pact weapon thereafter.  You can't affect an artifact or a sentient weapon in theis way.  The weapon ceases peing your pact weapon if you die, if yoru perform the 1-hour ritual on a different weapon ,or if you use a 1-hour ritual to break your bond to it.

<h4><a id="Pact_of_the_Tome_158"></a>Pact of the Tome</h4>

If they don't appear on the warlock spell list, they are nonetheless warlock spells for you.</p>
<p>If you lose your Book of Shadowns, you can perform a 1-hour ceremony to receive a replacement from your patron.  This ceremony can be performed during a short or long rest, and it destroyes the previous book.  The book turns to ash when you die.</p>

<h3><a id="Mystica_Arcanum_168"></a>Mystica Arcanum</h3>
<p>At 11th level, your patron bestows upon you a magical secret called an arcanum.  Choose one 6th-level spell from the warlock spell list as this arcanum.</p>
<p>You can cast your arcanum spell once without expending a spell slot.  You must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
<p>At higher levels, you gain more warlock spells of yoru choice that can be cast in this way: one 7th-levle spell at 13th level, once 8th-level spell at 15th elvel, and once 9th-level spell at 17th level.  You regain all uses of yoru Mystic Arcanum when you finish a long rest.</p>

You can spend 1 minute entreating your patron for aid to regain all your expened spell slots from yoru Pact Magic feature.  Once you regain spell slots with this feature, you must finish a long rest before you can do so again.</p>
<h5><a id="Your_Pact_Boon_180"></a>Your Pact Boon</h5>
<p>Each Pact Boon option produces a special creature or an object that reflects yoru patron's nature.</p>
<h6><a id="Pact_of_the_Chain_184"></a>Pact of the Chain.</h6>
<p>Your familiar is more cunning than a typical familiar.  It's default form can be a reflection of yoru patron, with sprites and pseudodragons tied to the Archfey and imps and quasits tied to the Fiend.  Because the Great Old One's nature is inscrutable, any familiar form is suitable for it.</p>
<h6><a id="Pact_of_the_Blade_188"></a>Pact of the Blade.</h6>
<p>If yoru patron is the Archfey, your weapon might be a slender blade wrapped in leafy vines.  If you serve the Fiend, your weapon could be an axe made of black metal and adorned with decorative flames.  If your patron is the Great Old One, your weapon might be an ancient-looking spear, with gemstone embedded in it's head, carved to look like a terrible unblinking eye.</p>
<h6><a id="Pact_of_the_Tome_192"></a>Pact of the Tome.</h6>
<p>Your Book of shadows might be a fine, gilt-edged tome with spells of enchantment and illusion, gifted to you by the lordly Archfey.  It could be a weighty tome bound in demon hide studded with iron, holding spells of conjuration and wealth of forbidden lore about the sinister regions of the cosmos, a gift of the Fiend.  Or it could be the tattered diary of a lunatic driven mad by contract with the Great Old One,holding scraps of spells that only your burgeioning insanity allows you to understand and cast.</p>
<h2><a id="Otherworldly_Patrons_196"></a>Otherworldly Patrons</h2>
<p>The beings that serve as patrons for warlocks are mighty inhabitants of other planes of existence-not gods, but almost godlike i ntheir power.  Various patrons give their warlock access to different powers and invocations, and expect significant favors in return.</p>
<p>Some patrons collect warlocks, doling out mystic knowledge relatively freely or boasting of their ability to bind mortals to their will.  Other patrons bestow their power only grudingly, and might make a pact with only one warlock.  Warlocks who serve the same patron might view each other as allies, siblings, or rivals.</p>
<h3><a id="The_Archfey_202"></a>The Archfey</h3>
<p>Your patron is a lord or lady of the fey, a creatur of legend who holds secrets that were forgotten before the mortal races were born.  This being's motivations are often inscrutable, and sometimes whimsical, and might involve a striving for greater magical power or the settlling of age-old grudges.  Beings of this sort include the Prince of Frost; the Queen of Air and Darkness, ruler of the Gloaming Court; Titania of the Summer Court; her consort Oberon, the Grean Lord; Hysam, the Prince of Fools; and ancient hags.</p>
<h4><a id="Expaned_Spell_List_206"></a>Expaned Spell List</h4>
<p>The Archfey lets you choose from an expanded list of spells when you learn a warlock spell.  The following spells are added to the wearlock spell list for you.</p>

<h4><a id="Fey_Presence_220"></a>Fey Presence</h4>
<p>Starting at 1st level, yoru patron bestows upon yo uthe ability to project the beguiling and fearsome presence of the fey.  As an action, you can cause each creature in a 10-foot cube originating from you to make a Wisdom saving throw against yoru warlock spell save DC.  The creatures that fail their saving throws are all charmed or frightned by you (your choice) until the end of your next turn.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it a gain until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4><a id="Misty_Excape_226"></a>Misty Excape</h4>
<p>Starting at 6th level, yo ucan vanish in a pusff of mist in response to harm.  When you take damage, you can use yoru reaction to turn invisible and teleport up to 60 feet to an unoccupied space you can see.  You remain invisible until the start of your next turn or until you attack or cast a spell.</p>
<p>Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a short or long rest.</p>
<h4><a id="Beguiling_Defenses_232"></a>Beguiling Defenses</h4>
<p>Beginning at 10th level, your patron teaches you how to turn the mind-affecting magic of your enemies against them.  You are immune to being charmed, and when another creature attempts to charm you, you can use your reaction to attempt to turn the charm back on that creature.  The creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw against yoru warlock spell save DC or be charmed by you for 1 minute or until the creature takes any damage.</p>
<h4><a id="Dark_Delirium_236"></a>Dark Delirium</h4>
<p>Starting at 14th level, you can plunge a creature into an illusory realm.  As an action, choose a creature that you can see within 60 feet of you.  It must make a Wisdom saving throw against your warlock spell save DC.  On a failed save, it is charmed or frightened by you (your choice) for 1 minute or until your concentration is broken (as if you are concentrating on a spell).  This effect ends early if the creature takes any damage.</p>
<p>Until this illusion ends, the creature thinks it is lost in a misty realm, the appearance of which you choose.  The creature can see and hear only itself, you, and the illusion.</p>
<p>You must finish a short or long rest before you can use this feature again.</p>
<h3><a id="The_Fiend_244"></a>The Fiend</h3>
<p>You have made a pact with a fiend from the lower planes of existence, a being whose aims are evil, even if you strive against those aims.  Such beings desire the corruption or destruction of all things, ultimately including you.
